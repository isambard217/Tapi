Technique Name,Brief Description
Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy,Good for heavy metal analysis. Can only determine the concentration of one element at a time. Good for determining accurate concentrations. Can detect low concentrations.
Inductive Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry,Scans for all metals. Gives a mass spectrum of elements present in a sample. Not good for determining accurate concentrations.
X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy,Scans for all metals. Gives a XRF spectrum. Good for determining the presence of elements in high concentration in the sample. 
Electrogravimetric Analysis,Good for heavy metal analysis. Can only determine the concentration of one element at a time. Good for determining accurate concentrations. Good for metals in high concentration.
Qualitative Spot Test,Good for determining the presence of a particular element  in the sample. 
Thin Layer Chromatography,Good for determining the presence of some organic species.
Gun Shot Residue Test,Determines the presence of gun shot residue on a sample.
Density Test,Determines the density of a given sample.
Magnetic Test,Determines if a sample is magnetic or not.
pH Test,Tests the pH (H+ concentration) of a given solution
